### Git Basics Summary
  Git is a version control program. It is used for tracking changes in computer files. Git does not have a specific language or framework, it can be used for anything.
  Git is quite useful because it allows developers to work on the same project without being in the same network. _Cool right_?
  
#### Basic Commands of Git
* $ git init      -  Initializes local git repository
* $ git add <file> -  Adds file to the staging area
* $ git status    -  Check status of working tree
* $ git commit -m "_FileToBeCommitted_"   -  Used to save all staged changes, commits are essential in Git
* $ git push      -  Push to remote repository
